SNAP: SN (Discrete Ordinates) Application Proxy

SNAP serves as a proxy application for the LANL deterministic transport code
PARTISN. It uses a parallelization strategy modeled off PARTISN. This includes
KBA sweeps coupled with distributed memory decomposition over the spatial domain
using MPI. Next, the energy domain is threaded, with work performed on the
cores of a multicore compute node or the accelerating chip of the hybrid
architecture, using OpenMP. Lastly it uses vectorization of the angular domain
(all angles in an octant).

SNAP has been written to the Fortran 90/95 standard. It has been successfully
built with, but not necessarily limited to, gfortran and ifort. Moreover, the
code has been built with the profiling tool Byfl. The accompanying Makefile
retains some of the old make options for different build types. However, the
current build system depends on the availability of MPI and OpenMP libraries.
Builds without these libraries will require modification to the source code to
remove related subroutine calls and directives.

MPI implementations typically suggest using a "wrapper" compiler to compile
the code. SNAP has been built and tested with OpenMPI. OpenMPI allows one to
set the underlying Fortran compiler with the environment variable OMPI_FC,
where the variable is set to the (path and) compiler of choice, e.g., ifort,
gfortran, etc.

The makefile currently uses:

  FORTRAN = mpif90

and all testing has been performed with

  OMPI_FC = [path]/ifort

Fortran compilation flags can be set according to the underlying compiler. The
current flags are set for the ifort compiler and using OpenMP for parallel
threading.

  TARGET = snap
  FFLAGS = -03 -openmp
  FFLAG2 =

where FFLAG2 is reserved for additional flags that may need applied differently,
depending on the compiler. To make SNAP with these default settings, simply type

  make

on the command line within the SNAP directory.

A debugging version of SNAP can be built by typing

  make OPT=no

on the command line. The unoptimized, debugging version of SNAP features
bounds checking, back-tracing an error, and the necessary debug compiler flags.
With ifort, these flags appear as:

  FFLAGS = -g -O0 -check bounds -traceback -openmp
  FFLAG2 =

The values for these compilation variables have been modified for various
Fortran compilers and the Makefile provides details of what has been used
previously. These lines are commented out for clarity at this time and to
ensure that changes to the build system are made carefully before attempting
to rebuild with a different compiler.

The SNAP directory can be cleaned up of its module and object files if the
user desires with:

  make clean

This removes all the *.mod and *.o files, as well as *.bc files from Byfl
builds. Moreover, it will enforce complete recompilation of all files upon
the next instance of "make" or "make OPT=no." Currently, there is no separate
directory for the compilation files of separate optimized and unoptimized
builds. The user must do a "make clean" before building the code if the
previous build used the opposite command.

Lastly, a line count report is generated with:

  make count

The line count report excludes blank lines and comments. It counts the number
of code lines in all *.f90 files and sums the results. The information is
printed to the the "Lines" file.

Because SNAP currently requires building with MPI, to execute SNAP, use the
following command:

  mpirun -np [#] [path]/snap [infile] [outfile]

This command will automatically run with the number of threads specified by
the input file, which is used to set the number of OpenMP threads, overwriting
any environment variable to set the number of threads. Testing has shown that
to ensure proper concurrency of work, the above command can be modified to

  mpirun -cpus-per-proc [#threads] -np [#procs] [path]/snap [infile] [outfile]

Lastly, a user may wish to test the various thread affinity settings used to
bind threads to processing elements. Testing has been done with with a disabled
Intel thread affinity interface.

  setenv KMP_AFFINITY disabled (csh)

The command line is read for the input/output file names. If one of the names
is missing, the code will not execute. Moreover, the output file overwrites
any pre-existing files of the same name.
